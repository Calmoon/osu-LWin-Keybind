# osu-LWin-Keybind
An AutoHotKey script for using the left Windows key as a keybind in the rhythm game osu!.

It makes it emulate the X key only while in-game; when not, it acts normally.  
That means you have to bind whatever it is you want the LWin key bound to, to X instead.  

Uses AutoHotIntercept because for some reason the LWin key is disabled at a very low level in osu!, so more absolute emulation is needed. 
Using just AutoHotKey for this only <i>kinda</i> works, but this works perfectly.  
It assumes you only have one keyboard connected.

Probably needs the <a href="http://www.oblita.com/interception">Interception driver</a> installed, I dunno.  
Better install just to be sure.

In fact, I have no idea what I'm doing -- this thing took a lot of time even though it's really simple.  
'Twas a good learning experience, at least.
